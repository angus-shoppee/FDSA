    <h1>Transcripts - Visualization of Splice Activity</h1>
    <strong>Overview</strong>
    <p>
        Summary information and visualisation for individual transcripts are given below. The sidebar may be used to
        navigate directly to transcripts by clicking on a given name under the "Transcripts" section.
        <br><br>
        Transcripts are ordered by splice event {rank_by}.{max_plotted_text}{max_per_group_text}{junction_limit_text}
    </p>
    <strong>Interpreting figures</strong>
    <p>
        Two figures are given for each transcript feature. The first compares gene expression against splice event
        detection rate. Gene expression (X axis) is calculated as counts per million (CPM) normalized using the
        Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM) method. Splice event detection rate (Y axis) is calculated as the percentage
        of RNA sequencing reads encompassing or overlapping the feature that contain a splice junction that encompasses
        or overlaps the feature.
        <br><br>
        The second figure depicts all detected splice junctions in each individual sample. Each exon is depicted as a
        box, labeled by exon number. Canonical splicing between adjacent exons is depicted with horizontal lines
        connecting boxes. Splicing between non-adjacent exons and/or involving alternative donor or acceptor sites is
        depicted with looping connections. Each splice junction is labelled with its number of occurrences.
